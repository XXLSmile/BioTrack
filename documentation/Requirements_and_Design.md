## 2. Project Description

BioTrack – Wildlife Scanner & Collection App

BioTrack is designed for hikers, tourists, birdwatchers, animal lovers, and scientists such as botanists, entomologists, and zoologists. These users often encounter plants, animals, or insects in the wild but struggle to identify and document them in a structured, accessible way. Existing solutions are either fragmented (separate apps for plants, birds, or insects) or too technical for casual users.

The project aims to bridge this gap by providing a simple yet powerful mobile app that allows users to scan and identify wildlife instantly and store observations in personal or shared catalogs. This helps both casual explorers and professional researchers keep track of biodiversity, share findings with friends or collaborators, and learn more about the natural world around them.

## 3. Requirements Specification

### **3.1. List of Features**
1. **Authentication**: To access the app, a user must sign in using the Google authentication service. New users should sign up before signing in. An authenticated user can sign out. Users can also remove their account.
2. **Wildlife Recognition**: A user can scan and recognize wildlife using their devices camera. The app uses an external API to process the image and identify the wildlife species. When identified, the user can see basic information about the wildlife, like its name, habitat, rarity etc. The user can then catalog the species.
3. **Catalog**: A user can create a catalog and save scanned wildlife to the catalog. Each entry contains information about the species and when and where the species was scanned. Users can make multiple catalogs as well as share catalogs with friends, where they can catalog entries in real time.
4. **Manage Friends**: A user can add friends by searching for their username. A user can view their friends list, accept friend requests and remove friends. Based on species catalogged by a user, friend reccommendations will be suggested to the user based on catalog similarity to other users. Users can share scanned wildlife and catalogs with friends

### **3.2. Use Case Diagram**

![use_case_diagram](images/useCaseDiagram.png)

### **3.3. Actors Description**
1. **User**: The primary actor who interacts with the BioTrack app. Users can scan wildlife, view identifications, save observations to catalogs, manage their collections, and optionally share findings with friends or collaborators.
2. **External Authentication Service**: A third-party provider that verifies a user’s identity and manages secure login and account syncing across devices.
3. **External Image Recognition Service**: An API that processes photos uploaded by the user and returns likely species identifications along with confidence scores.
4. **Push Notification Service**: A cloud-based service that delivers real-time alerts to users such as friend activity updates.

### **3.4. Use Case Description**
- Use cases for feature 1: Authentication
1. **Sign-Up**: Create an account by registering with google authentication API before accessing the app.
2. **Sign-In**: An existing user logs into the app using their google account to access features
3. **Create Profile**: an existing user can create a profile connected to their google account to store catalogs and friends.
4. **Sign-Out**: The user logs out of the app by logging out of their google account
5. **Remove Account**: the user deletes their google account from the app.
- Use cases for feature 2: Wildlife Recognition
6. **Get Picture**: The user takes a photo of wildlife using the apps camera feature or uploads a photo already in device storage.
7. **Scan Picture**: The app scans the picture and identifies the wildlife and description of the wildlife (eg. species type, mammel, rarity, endarngered) using an external recognition API.
- Use cases for feature 3: Catalog
8. **Create Catalog**: The user creates a personal collection to store the picture taken of the wildlife as well as the time and location of the sighting and the description of the wildlife and organize by species encountered wildlife. The user can title catalogs and make mulitple catalogs
9. **Delete Catalog**: The user deletes their catalog, permanently removing all stored encounters in said catalog.
10. **Edit Catalog**: The user can edit their catalog name, and remove entries from the catalog.
11. **Catalog Scanned Picture**: After scanning, the user saves the identified species along with the time and location of the sighting via google maps as well as a description of the species to their catalog. 
- Use cases for feature 4: Manage Friends
12. **Add Friends**: The user can send or accept friend requests to connect with other app users. Users can search for usernames to add friends as well as remove friends from their friendslist. When users search for friends, there will be a reccommended list of friends the user can add based on catalog similarity.
13. **Share Catalog**: The user can share one or multiple of their catalogs with friends. Friends can view the catalog or, if the catalog owner gives permission for collaboration, friends can contribute their own pictures to the catalog. The owner of the catalog can revoke collaboration permissions and remove friends from a catalog at any time.
14. **Share Scanned Picture**: The user can share a single scanned wildlife picture as well a brief description of the scanned wildlife directly with friends. The users friends will get a push notification when a scanned picture is shared with them.

### **3.7. Non-Functional Requirements**
<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **Recognition Latency**
    - **Description**: The app must return wildlife recognition results within ≤ 10 seconds for almost all scans.
    - **Justification**: Real-time wildlife identification is a core value proposition; if results take too long, the app feels unusable in outdoor/field settings. The 10-second threshold balances API response times, network variability, and user patience. (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/)
<a name="nfr2"></a>

2. **UI/UX Accessibility**
    - **Description**: The app’s UI/UX should be usable and accessible for the vast majority of our diverse user base, including new hikers and experienced researchers.
    - **Justification**: The goal of this app is to provide a simplified, intuitive way for users to scan, keep track of, and learn about wildlife they encounter, so the UI must be inclusive. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-accessibility-matters-in-ui-ux-design/).
<a name="nfr3"></a>

3. **Privacy & Data Protection**
    - **Description**: All personal data (friend lists, catalog entries, location metadata) must be stored securely in the cloud database with encryption. Users must be able to delete all their data upon account removal.
    - **Justification**: We must comply with Canadian data protection laws such as PIPEDA (https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/) by collecting only necessary data and providing a complete deletion flow.

### **4.2. Databases**
**MongoDB + Mongoose ODM**
    - **Purpose**: Primary document store for `users`, `species`, `catalogs`, `entries`, `friendships`, and share invitations. Schemas encode indexes for lookups (owner, status, species) while keeping the flexibility needed for evolving recognition metadata. Mongoose models (e.g., `catalogModel`, `friendshipModel`) centralise validation and lifecycle hooks.


### **4.3. External Modules**
1. **Zyla Animal Recognition API**
    - **Purpose**: Performs wildlife classification from still images; the backend streams uploads to this API and normalises the response into our `RecognitionResult` type.
2. **Google Maps Platform (Maps Compose + Geocoding API)**
    - **Purpose**: Displays map overlays in the Android client and translates coordinates into city/province metadata through the Geocoding REST endpoint.
3. **Firebase Cloud Messaging**
    - **Purpose**: Delivers push notifications for friend invitations, catalog shares, and real-time updates when collaborators add entries.
4. **Google Identity Services**
    - **Purpose**: Supplies Google Sign-In on Android and server-side token verification so we can authenticate users without storing passwords.



### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **Android Jetpack Stack (Kotlin, Compose, Hilt, CameraX, Coroutines)**
    - **Purpose**: Compose renders the reactive UI, CameraX captures photos, Hilt wires view models/repositories, and Coroutines keep network calls off the main thread.
    - **Reason**: Delivers a modern, testable Android architecture that meets the course’s native-app requirement.
2. **Retrofit 2 + OkHttp**
    - **Purpose**: Generates type-safe HTTP clients for the Android app, handles multipart uploads, and centralises auth header management.
    - **Reason**: Simplifies calling our REST APIs and external services from Kotlin with minimal boilerplate.
3. **Node.js 20 + Express 4 + Socket.IO**
    - **Purpose**: Express hosts REST endpoints, Socket.IO streams real-time catalog updates, and native ES modules keep the stack lightweight.
    - **Reason**: Matches the team’s experience, has rich middleware support, and integrates cleanly with TypeScript tooling.
4. **TypeScript + Zod + Mongoose**
    - **Purpose**: TypeScript enforces compile-time contracts, Zod validates request payloads, and Mongoose maps MongoDB collections to strongly-typed models.
    - **Reason**: Prevents runtime schema drift and codifies validation logic alongside the data layer.
5. **Docker + Docker Compose**
    - **Purpose**: Packages the backend, MongoDB, and supporting services for local development and deployment parity.
    - **Reason**: Provides reproducible environments and one-command startup for testers.
6. **GitHub Actions**
    - **Purpose**: Automates linting, builds, and container pushes for both Android and backend projects.
    - **Reason**: Gives the team consistent CI feedback before merging changes.


### **4.5. Dependencies Diagram**

![dependencies_diagram](images/CPEN321M2-DependencyDiagramV2.drawio.png)

### **4.6. Use Case Sequence Diagram (5 Most Major Use Cases)**
1. [**Get Picture**](#uc1) — Android Client uses CameraX to capture an image and stage metadata before invoking `WildlifeApi.recognizeAnimal`.\
![sequence_diagram1](images/getPicture.png)
2. [**Scan Picture**](#uc2) — The mobile app calls `POST /api/recognition`, which triggers `RecognitionService.recognizeFromUrl` and the Zyla API adapter.\
![sequence_diagram2](images/scanPicture.png)
3. [**Catalog Scanned Picture**](#uc3) — Recognition results flow into `CatalogEntryLinkModel.linkEntry` so the catalog gains the new observation.\
![sequence_diagram3](images/catalogScannedPicture.png)
4. [**Add Friends**](#uc4) — Friend requests travel through `FriendApi.sendFriendRequest` to `FriendshipModel.createRequest`, emitting an FCM notification.\
![sequence_diagram4](images/addFriends.png)
5. [**Share Scanned Picture**](#uc5) — Sharing a photo updates collaborators via `SocketManager.emitCatalogEntriesUpdated` and notifies them through FCM.\
![sequence_diagram5](images/shareScannedPicture.png)


### **4.7. Design and Ways to Test Non-Functional Requirements**
1. [**Recognition Latency**](#nfr1)
    - **Implementation**: `RecognitionService.recognizeFromUrl` streams images to the Zyla API with axios’ async pipeline, enforces a 30s timeout, and persists species via `speciesRepository.findOrCreate` so repeat recognitions reuse cached metadata. On the client, `CameraScreen` compresses captures to JPEG before Retrofit uploads, trimming payload size to keep end-to-end latency below the 10 s budget.
2. [**UI/UX Accessibility**](#nfr2)
    - **Implementation**: Compose screens rely on Material 3 components, typography scales, and `stringResource` labels, while `FriendViewModel` exposes loading/error state through `StateFlow` so each screen shows progress indicators and retry actions compatible with TalkBack and large-font settings.
3. [**Privacy & Data Protection**](#nfr3)
    - **Implementation**: `AuthService.signInWithGoogle` validates Google ID tokens and issues short-lived JWTs that `authenticateToken` requires for every catalog, recognition, and friend route, preventing unauthorised access. When a user invokes `DELETE /api/user/profile`, `UserController.deleteProfile` calls `friendshipModel.deleteAllForUser` and `userModel.delete` to remove their data and disconnect friends, aligning with the deletion guarantees.
